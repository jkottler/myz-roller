# Mutant Year Zero Dice Roller

The app is live here: https://jkottler.github.io/myz-roller/

This simple app is designed to allow you to play the _Mutant: Year Zero_ line of tabletop RPGs from [Free League](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/en/games/mutant-year-zero/) without physical access to their customized dice.

Operation should be self-explanatory: Set the number of base (yellow), skill (green), and gear (black) dice to be rolled with the on-screen controls. Press the **Roll** button to roll them. Click the **Push** button to push a roll.

* 22 Mar. 2023 - A number of security and compatibility updates were applied. (v0.2.1)

* 17 Nov. 2022 - To accommodate Talents and cirucmstances that allow multiple Pushes, the 1-push limit has been removed. The dice display now also clears when the number of dice is changed, to avoid confusion about whether a given pool has been rolled or not. (v0.2.0)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). See documentation there for details.
